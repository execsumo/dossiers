# Dossier

**A local, single-user durable memory layer for long-running work in Claude Code.**

Dossier keeps a topic of work alive across Claude Code sessions. You *promote* a session into a **Dossier** — the critical state of the topic (situation, decisions and who made them, open questions, next action) with the noise stripped out — backed by an **Archive** of the raw material it came from. Every claim cites its source. Next session you resume with exactly the distilled context you need, and the full archive is one search away.

No database, no cloud, no account. Your data is plain Markdown under `~/.dossier/` that you can open in any editor (e.g. Obsidian).

## Quickstart

Requires **Claude Code** on macOS or Linux.

**Option A — prebuilt binary (recommended)**

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/execsumo/dossiers/releases), make it executable, and run `init`:

```bash
# example for macOS Apple Silicon
curl -L https://github.com/execsumo/dossiers/releases/latest/download/dossier-darwin-arm64 -o dossier
chmod +x dossier
./dossier init        # installs to a stable PATH, then wires up Claude Code
```

**Option B — build from source** (requires Go 1.26+)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/execsumo/dossiers.git
cd dossiers
go build ./cmd/dossier
./dossier init
```

That single `init` does everything:

- copies the binary to a stable location on your `PATH` (`~/.local/bin/dossier`) so its path never changes,
- creates your workspace at `~/.dossier`, and
- registers Dossier's **MCP server** and **session hooks** in Claude Code (after a confirmation prompt — pass `-y` to skip it).

It's idempotent and non-clobbering: your existing MCP servers and hooks are preserved, and every config file is backed up before editing. Re-run it anytime, and check things with `dossier doctor`.

## Using it

### Inside Claude Code (the main way)

Once `init` has run, Dossier works on its own:

- **At session start**, your open Dossiers are surfaced into the conversation, sorted by priority — so you and the agent can pick up where you left off.
- **During the session**, the agent recalls, saves, searches, promotes, and switches Dossiers through MCP tools — nothing for you to remember. Switching binds *this* session (the MCP server resolves your Claude Code session automatically), so concurrent sessions can each follow a different Dossier without stepping on each other.
- **At session end and before compaction**, hooks save the active Dossier so context isn't lost.

A shipped **Distillation Guide** tells the agent *what* to keep; the hooks decide *when* to save. There's no confirmation gate — trust comes from the fact that nothing is ever deleted (superseded content moves to the Archive and audit log) and every claim carries a source link.

### From the command line

Everything is scriptable too. The CLI, MCP, and hooks are thin layers over one core, so they behave identically.

```bash
# Promote a topic into a Dossier (optionally seed its distilled state)
dossier promote "payments-migration" --distilled "## Situation
Migrating billing off the legacy gateway.
## Next action
Confirm webhook signing keys with the vendor."

dossier ls                        # open Dossiers, by priority
dossier show payments-migration   # full distilled state + metadata
dossier search "webhook"          # search distilled state + archives
dossier next payments-migration "Write the cutover runbook"
dossier priority payments-migration --importance h --urgency h
dossier link payments-migration --from-file ./notes.md   # attach a source to the archive
dossier merge old-slug payments-migration                # fold one Dossier into another
dossier archive payments-migration                       # archive (never deletes)
```

Full reference: `dossier --help`.

### In the terminal UI

For interactive browsing and editing, launch the full-screen TUI — run `dossier` with no arguments, or `dossier tui`:

```bash
dossier        # or: dossier tui
```

It opens a priority-sorted dashboard of your open Dossiers. From there you can:

- **open** a Dossier to read its distilled state (with a live token estimate and over-target warning). The distilled state is rendered as rich markdown natively in the terminal. The view live-refreshes automatically when Claude Code updates the dossier in the background.
- **edit** status, priority (importance/urgency/due date), and next action inline,
- **link** a source, resolving ambiguous matches by picking from ranked candidates, and
- **merge** one Dossier into another, resolving any conflicts in a syntax-highlighted side-by-side view (sources are archived, never deleted).

The TUI is a thin layer over the same core as the CLI and MCP, so it behaves identically — `q` quits, `?` toggles help.

## How it works

Each Dossier is a directory under `~/.dossier/<slug>/`:

- **Distilled State** — one curated Markdown file: the topic with noise removed, not a lossy summary.
- **Archive** — the captured source artifacts that the distilled claims cite.
- **audit.log** — an append-only record of every change.

One Go binary serves the CLI, the MCP-over-stdio server, and the session hooks. There's no daemon — it runs on demand, invoked by you, by the hooks, or by the MCP server. **Nothing is ever deleted:** superseded content moves to the Archive and audit log.

## Good to know

- **Claude Code only.** Claude Code exposes the full set of hooks, MCP, and transcript capture Dossier relies on. Other harnesses (Codex, Antigravity) are out of scope. If a capability is missing in a given session, Dossier says so at install and at session start rather than failing silently.
- **Config lives in two files.** Hooks go in `~/.claude/settings.json`; the MCP server goes in `~/.claude.json` (the only place Claude Code reads user-scope MCP servers). Both store the absolute path of the stable binary — if you rebuild, rename, or move it, re-run `dossier install` then `dossier init` to re-bind, idempotently.
- **Token counts are estimates.** Dossier uses a BPE tokenizer benchmarked against Opus 4.8; it won't match every model exactly. The 100k-token figure is a configurable warning threshold, not a hard cap — Dossier warns, it never silently truncates.
- **Wiring it up by hand.** If you'd rather not let `init` edit your config: register the MCP server with `claude mcp add dossier -- dossier mcp serve`, and run `dossier hook session-start` to see what the start hook emits.
