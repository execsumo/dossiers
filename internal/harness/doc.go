/*
Package harness implements capability detection and hook integration for Claude Code.

It provides the implementation of core.Harness and core.HarnessRegistry for Claude Code,
the single supported client harness in v1. It reads, merges, and writes Claude Code's
config (~/.claude.json and ~/.claude/settings.json) to register the Dossier MCP server
and lifecycle hooks, detecting available capabilities (MCP, session-start/end and
pre-compaction hooks, transcript capture) so missing ones can be surfaced rather than
silently skipped.
